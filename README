Simple STILT analyses of Uintah Basin methane emissions
Idea is to calculate AFTERNOON enhancements (CH4_HPL - CH4_FRU), and then divide by total footprint strength:
  F_CH4 = (CH4_HPL - CH4_FRU)/sum(foot_i,j)

Then see how stable F_CH4 is over different seasons and years.

Thanks Ryan!  Let's focus on March~May 2016 for the Uintah Basin analyses then.

If you want I can generate actual uncertainty numbers using Logan's interpolated method. All in all I think this is a good time period for the analysis especially given the CSP data.
