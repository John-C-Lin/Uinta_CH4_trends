Code to process the State of Utah's Oil/Gas Data
Monthly production data downloaded from:  https://oilgas.ogm.utah.gov/oilgasweb/live-data-search/lds-prod/prod-main.xhtml
NOTE: Using a well's API Number (American Petroleum Institute standard format for numbering) is usually the most acurate way to pinpoint searches for individual wells. All API numbers for Utah wells begin with 43 (the API state code for Utah). The next 3 digits represent the county ( see county codes ). Digits 6 thru 10 are a sequential number assigned when a new well is permitted for drilling. A search done where "API Well Number is Like 43037" will retrieve all wells in San Juan County.”
“43013”, starting with “43”, which denotes Utah wells
“013” refers to wells in Duchesne county
So "43013" downloads all well data from Duchesne county
So "43047" downloads all well data from Uintah county
